# Analysis and Modelling of Urban Footfal Data in York City Centre

### Abstract
This repository presents one of my projects completed during my MSc at City University.<br>
In this project I look at footfall data from five distinct streets in the center of York (U.K.) <br>
collected as daily times series. This data is supplemented with weather (temperature and precipitation) <br>
and business occupancy time series as well as introducing auto-regressive features into the initial dataset <br>
to model and predict daily footfall for each each street. I compare and contrast random forests and <br>
regularised and non-regularised linear regression models on this augmented dataset.<br>
